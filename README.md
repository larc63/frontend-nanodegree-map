## Known Issues
* For some reason of blanket.js' internals, it throws an error saying that you can't apply bindings more than once, but code coverage works regardless.
* The checked binding was/isn't working for the tabs in the infoWindow, so a workaround has been implemented, this may or may not need addressing in the future.


# TODOs and other dreams for the future
* Add a neighborhood search to change neighborhoods.
* Make the list a list of places to visit, not the filtered results.
* Add arbitrary markers and get their geolocation info.
* Add an export list feature to have a printable/presentable way of exploring the area after researching.
* Add more tests.
